INVERSION TEST: use SAMPLE4
-
Verb: inversion -resides in _cal_ and calls in-turn into inver* locales.
-
key verb: inversion itself is called by: beval ("backward-evaluation")
-
breakback''	shows a diagram of the basic inversion algorithm
	breakback_cal_ -defined in utilities.ijs
-
NOTATION:
  ! -- must not change for duration of (inversion-)invocation
  ] -- computed from other workvars
  ? -- notional -- need not be created here
  argLEFT(x), argRIGHT(y) -- args of invocation: argLEFT inversion argRIGHT
	argLEFT  is typically: X0
	argRIGHT is typically: dY0
====
?X		notional abscissa in the abstract algorithm
?Y		notional ordinate in the abstract algorithm
!X0		==argLEFT; X initial value, from invocation
?Y0		Y initial value = fwdX0=: fwd(X0)
]X1		X final value returned by: inversion
?Y1		Y final value = fwdX1=: fwd(X1)
!dY		(non-iterative) INCREMENT of manual alt'n to Y
!dY0		==argRIGHT; the INCREMENT of manual alt'n to Y
		--(NOT the overtyped Y itself, == Y0D !!!)
!Y0D		==Y0+argRIGHT ==Y0+dY0
		--(sometimes counfounded with Y1)
]dX		limit of d1X, d2X, …, d_X, …, dX (as retd by: g)
		--the change to be made to X0 to bring it to X1
]d_X		iterated estimate of ΔX (d_X--> dX as n--> _)
]d1X		1st value of d_X, starts at 1 (nudged)
?d2X		2nd value of d_X, …etc
-
Verb: endstop -simply returns x-arg unchanged
(Does it have to generate the error message itself?
 Or return a value of X which won't yield the delta: y ?)
---NO, it seems. Just return an unchanged X.
--the result is the "resists value" message.
-
TO DO: Walkthru how cal responds to endstop,
 recognising/signalling failure.

NB. ========================================================
NB. (tolerant) implements "official" J defn of tolerant equality
NB. But I prefer to use (approximates) with N-R
NB. -because I want the "slack" (±TOLERANCE) to be the
NB.  same in the neighbourhood of 0 as in the neighbourhood of 1
NB.  whereas (tolerant) has less and less slack as Y0D --> 0
NB. HOWEVER I want (approximates) to stay slacker than J itself
NB. -hence the overriding condition: '(x=y) or …'

tolerant=: 4 : '(|x-y) <: TOLERANCE * (>./|x,y)'
NB. approximates=: 4 : 'TOLERANCE >: |x-y'
approximates=: 4 : '(x=y) or (TOLERANCE >: |x-y)'
